# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis

### Purpose
  For this project, the school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School(THS) are suspect and may have been altered. The goal of this analysis is to update the data analysis already completed so that the values associated with 9th grade reading and math scores are updated with NaNs. This will prevent the tampered scores from skewing the results.

## School District Analysis Summary

This election script can easily be used - with slight modifications - to summarize election data for any type of election. For example, if this was a city election instead of a county election, the code could be easily updated by replacing the word "county" with "city". You would only need to verify that the city name was in the second column of the provided data - or make a small update to the code to refer to the correct column. Similarily you could update the code for a election for a local bill instead of a candidate. You would only need to replace the word "candidate" with "bill" in the code, and verify that the bill name was in the third column of the provided data - or make a small update to the code to refer to the correct column.
